* Add action for pan mode for the toolbar
* Initial Window State + Centralizing of Model
* Undo/redo stack/triggerAction.
* Medea freezes if you keep triggering new project. (on Mac)

Dan To Fix:

* settings into tab
* Fix Duplicate in Controller.
* Add catch for when an AggregateInstance is constructed inside of its definition.

Cathlyn To Fix:
* Need to make sure that the definition dock only shows kinds which are returned from the list of getAdoptableNodeKinds()
* Fix getNextChildPos() in NodeItem. (doesnt' work consistantly for sorting Aspect)
* Work out useful short cuts for recursive sort and normal sort.
* Add scrollbar for nodekinds menu in search options.
Fixed:
* Fixed theme updates  for modelitem, clusters, toolbar and the view.
* Added aspect check for search
* Hardware dock not updating/clearing highlighted item until selection is changed.
* Updated toolbar for multiple selection to deal with Entity and Aspect items.
* Call NodeView::expandSelection(bool expand) from toolbar.
* Connect tool button/menu showing for AspectItems.
* Fixed search suggestions size problem; ignoring text truncation at the moment.
* Fixed filtering of definitions dock for different allowed kinds and construction of connected node for Aggregate and Vector instances.
* Fixed missing expand/contract buttons.
* Edge constructed signal is not getting sent from the view - docks not updating correctly.
* Stopped toolbar from showing in subviews.
* Fixed empty parts dock after new project is called.
* Added extra check for Vectors for the definitions dock. - Multiple updates are coming from edge/node construction/destruction
* The definitions dock can now only be accessed through the parts dock and it returns to the parts dock after an item in it has been clicked.
* Fixed switching between fullscreen and maximised state.
* Updated selectAndCenterItem in NodeView to use setStateExpanded.
* Re-added centering of node items when double-clicked (hitbox for EntityItem is the bodyRect).
  ** Switched double-click and middle click of aspect buttons. (Double-click now turns on and center).
