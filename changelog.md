# re v1.1.0

## New Features:
Relative to previous solutions, RE has several new features.
* Dynamic Component compilation
    * Components requiring unsupported middlewares are no longer compiled
    * Components are now built as dynamic libraries
    * Components that are not deployed are no longer loaded into the runtime
* Dynamic runtime
    * Model attributes can now be modified by external tools during runtime
    * Components can now be dynamically activated/deactivated during execution
* Performance
    * Redesigned from the ground up to have minimal execution overhead
    * Lightweight middleware (ZMQ) used for model execution control
* Model Logging
    * Logging of model events is now built into the runtime environment. This can be run in either live or cached mode (or disabled entirely)
* C++11 support
    * RE exploits many language features new to C++11, resulting in an easier to read and maintain codebase.
