# Version 2.0.0
## New Features:

### General
* MEDEA's GUI/UX has been redesigned with modular dock widgets used to contain views and tools.
 * The dock widgets can be resized, moved and undocked to provide user with complete freedom for tool layouts.
* Redesigned MEDEA's MVC connections between the Model Controller and the View
* Implemented XMI/UML Import functionality for loading datastructures
* Implemented QoS modelling for DDS based middlewares
* Implemented a Notification Panel which keeps track of notifications after they have been toasted to the user.

### View
* Each Aspect now has it's own view, contained in a dock widget.
 * Each dock widget has it's own selection. All tools will update based on the current active view.
* Sub Views are now fully editable and have the same functionality as the aspect views.
* NodeView has been overhauled, with efforts to improve the render performance of large systems.
* Zoom based render-quality has been further improved, with text and icon mipmapping occurs/

### Tools
* The Data Table, View Minimap, View Manager, Dock and Application Toolbar all use modular dock widgets.

# Version 1.5.2
## New Features:
### Jenkins
* MEDEA can now run a job indefinately, by setting a duration of 0 seconds.
** A special button now appears in the Jenkins Job Monitor to terminate the job
* Jenkins Job Monitor uses a monospaced font for better readability.
* Jenkins Job Monitor now provides a URL link for the Jenkins page relative to the job and job number.

# Version 1.5.1
## New Features:

### General
* Updated the DDS_Logging_Server Management component to support new DIG-SLC logging capabilities

### Jenkins
* Jenkins settings are validated on Launch
* Jenkins settings are also validated after these settings have been changed/applied.
* MEDEA now informs the user via notification whether or not Jenkins settings have been validated (And what settings are invalid)
* Implemented the ability to close tabs in the JenkinsJobMonitorWidget (Which stops the flow of data from the Jenkins CLI)

### Dock
* Dock will now remain open if the selection changes; it still closes if there is no selection
* Added a new entity Worker Process to replace previous Process
* Process now constructs a **legacy** Process for using non-integrated workers
* Added functionality to swap the Hardware Dock from deploy mode to center on mode (swaps automatically based on selection)
* Fixed visual bug with switching from the Definitions Dock to the Nodes dock

### Toolbar
* Added functionality to modify the **replicate_count** for a selection of ComponentAssemblies
* Added functionality to un-deploy a selection of deployed entities
* Added functionality to launch the wiki page describing the current selected entity.
* Added functionality to set/unset a selection as read-only. Read-Only mode will only allow visual changes, not functional/model changes.
* Extended the **Connect** tool button to allow multiple selected entites to connect to a shared legal entity
* Fixed the missing **View Connections** tool button

### Selection
* Implemented the ability to have an **Active Selected Item** in a multiple item selection
 * Added the ability to Tab/Shift+Tab to change the currently active selected item.
 * The active selected item will have the table shown
 * The active selected item will have a dark blue outline, whilst the other items in the current selection have a lighter blue border.
 * Clicking on an item whilst it's selected will set that item as the active selected item.

## Bug Fixes
* MEDEA now properly disables the Jenkins functionality if incorrect settings are applied, or validation cannot be run
* Fixed a bug in which Notifications where not being hidden after timeout had expired in certain circumstances
